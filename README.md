# **6WD\_controller\_6204**
This project is created for the class ELE6204A at Polytechnique Montreal, as a project on nonlinear systems. The goal is to implement a 6 wheel skid-steering control for a robot. The system is not fully functionnal at the moment, depending mainly on wheel friction coefficients and speed necessaries to operate the robot.
 
This is the implementation of a 6WD controller based on the article: 
"Dynamic control of the 6WD skid-steering mobile robot RobuROC6
using sliding mode technique" by E. Lucet et al.
 
This ROS controller is based on the tutorials and examples of of: 
 - Jonathan Cacace - https://github.com/jocacace/my_controller
 - NASA JSC Robotics - https://gitlab.com/nasa-jsc-robotics/valkyrie/-/wikis/How-To-Write-A-Controller-For-Valkyrie
